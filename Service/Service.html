			Thus service is a stateless object that contains some useful functions. These functions can be called from <br /> anywhere; Controllers, Directive, Filters etc. Thus we can divide our application in logical units. The business <br /> logic or logic to call HTTP url to fetch data from server can be put within a service object.<br />
			
			Putting business and other logic within services has many advantages. First it fulfills the principle of separation <br />of concern or segregation of duties. Each component is responsible for its own work making application more<br /> manageable. Second this way each component can be more testable. AngularJS provides first class support for <br /> unit testing. Thus we can quickly write tests for our services making them robust and less error prone <br />

			Consider above diagram. Here we divide our application in two controllers: 1. Profile and 2. Dashboard. Each of<br/> these controllers require certain user data from server. Thus instead of repeating the logic to fetch data from<br/> server in each controller, we create a User service which hides the complexity. AngularJS automatically inject<br/> User service in both Profile and Dashboard controller. Thus our application becomes for modular and testable.

		<b> AngularJS Service vs Factory</b>
			AngularJS services as already seen earlier are singleton objects. These objects are application wide. Thus a <br/>service object once created can be used within any other services or controllers etc.

			<br/>We saw there are two ways (actually four, but for sake of simplicity lets focus on 2 ways that are widely used)<br/> of defining an angularjs service. Using module.factory and module.service.
			<br/>
			module.service( 'serviceName', function );
			<br/>
			module.factory( 'factoryName', function );<br/>
			When declaring serviceName as an injectable argument you will be provided with an instance of the function. In<br/> other words new FunctionYouPassedToService(). This object instance becomes the service object that AngularJS<br/> registers and injects later to other services / controllers if required.<br/>

			When declaring factoryName as an injectable argument you will be provided with the value that is returned by<br/> invoking the function reference passed to module.factory.<br/>

			In below example we define MyService in two different ways. Note how in .service we create service methods using<br/> this.methodname. In .factory we created a factory object and assigned the methods to it.
