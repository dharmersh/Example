			<!-- If we try injecting $routeProvider into our controller like so:

			app.controller("AppCtrl", function($scope, $routeProvider){
			
			We can see that we get an error in the console that $routeProviderProvider is not available.
			This is because it’s actually looking for a service that’s created by a provider so we only need $route.
			Now if we try to inject $route into our config function, we can see that we get an unknown provider error.
			This is because at the config phase of the app, we only have providers available to us, which are the factories that generate an instance of things like $route. So let’s try manipulating $route in our controller. Comment out what’s in our config function, and move the route declaration to our controller. -->
